# baby agi??

*  Inspired / playing with this code.

<https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agents/baby_agi.html>

* Rewrote it  to work better for how I think.
`src/C2_my_implementation.py` is the update code.
* seems like it works. 

You need my other lib

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/garland3/llminterface.git
```
